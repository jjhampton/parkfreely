# Parkfreely
A highly optimized crowdsourced free parking application built for the Greenville, SC community.

I built this as part of a team at the 2015 <a href="http://www.imagineupstate.org/">Imagine Upstate</a> Civic Hackathon using Ember.js.  This rapid prototype was built over a 24 hour sprint. The original design planned for an Ember front-end and a Django back-end server.
